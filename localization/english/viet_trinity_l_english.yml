 VIETtrinity.0001.t:0 "Translating the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText|U]"
 VIETtrinity.0001.desc:0 "Lately, a number of [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] have communicated to me their reservations about various translations of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] into their local, vernacular languages. It can be difficult, I know. On one hand, we want to preach [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings to as many  as we can. On the other hand, it is easy to distort the word of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] and insert heretical ideas - wittingly or not - when the translation is sloppy\n\n Anyways, I’ve decided to write a few letters to some of these more prominent [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to help guide them with these problems. What should I tell them? What should I say to encourage them, as their [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], so that they know how to tell if a translation is good?"
 VIETtrinity.0001.a:0 "If they trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], surely all will be well."
 VIETtrinity.0001.b:0 "They must carefully study the words and intentions of the translators."
 VIETtrinity.0001.c:0 "If needed, they should consult each other and other learned people."
 VIETtrinity.0001.d:0 "I should tell them techniques I know to gauge translations' accuracy."
 VIETtrinity.0001.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! Contrary to common belief, vernacular translations of the Bible were not unheard of in medieval Europe. The only issue for the Catholic Church was if these translations were believed to contradict Church orthodoxy and encourage heretical ideas. Pope Innocent III, for example, gave the following advice to his priests and bishops about these translations: “#italic Inquire and find out the truth: who was the translator of that translation, what was the intention of the translator, what do its users believe, why do they teach, and do they uphold the Apostolic see and the Catholic faith?#!”"
 VIETtrinity.0002.t:0 "We're Family, Right?"
 VIETtrinity.0002.desc:0 "[relative.GetTitledFirstName] has approached me requesting for some… “blessings,” as [relative.GetSheHe] calls it. Of course, I understand entirely what [reltaive.GetSheHe] #italic really#! means.\n\n As the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I can help [relative.GetHerHim] grease some wheels, since [relative.GetSheHe] is related to me, after all. This is not a bribe, of course - [relative.GetSheHe] wouldn’t dare be brazen enough to request me to explicitly do a favor for [relative.GetHerHim]. Simply, [relative.GetSheHe] just wants me to help [relative.GetHerHim] deal with any troublesome local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and to look better in everyone’s eyes by communicating to others about what a good [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName] I am. After all, aren’t we family?"
 VIETtrinity.0002.a:0 "I won’t provide any special favors just because we happen to be related."
 VIETtrinity.0002.b:0 "I'll see what I can do. Mention [relative.GetHerHim] in a sermon? Write letters praising [relative.GetHerHim]?"
 VIETtrinity.0002.c:0 "If [relative.GetSheHe] wants help, perhaps [relative.GetSheHe] is willing to give a donation?"
 VIETtrinity.0003.t:0 "An Immense Burden"
 VIETtrinity.0003.desc:0 "Sometimes, I feel my responsibilities as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] are simply so immense. Too immense, even. I must lead every [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentName] in the world, and guide them towards the wisdom and love of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]. Am I truly worthy of such a thing? The expectations weigh on me deeply, and lately, I have just been feeling overwhelmed."
 VIETtrinity.0003.a:0 "I know I must trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 VIETtrinity.0003.b:0 "This is an important duty! Someone must do it."
 VIETtrinity.0003.c:0 "I don’t know if there’s any point to this all, but it’s my fate."
 VIETtrinity.0004.t:0 "Advice for a Legate"
 VIETtrinity.0004.desc:0 "Today, one of my legates will travel to a faraway land to be my representative to the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural] who live there. Before that happens, however, the two of us have a short audience, and my legate is expressing doubt and uncertainty about this assignment, and if I had any advice to give."
 VIETtrinity.0004.a:0 "Beware the secular rulers, they are a greedy, violent lot."
 VIETtrinity.0004.b:0 "Trust in [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], have faith, and all will work out."
 VIETtrinity.0004.c:0 "Be prudent and wise, so that you may best represent us."
 VIETtrinity.0005.t:0 "Promising Candidates"
 VIETtrinity.0005.desc:0 "Today, I have the opportunity to choose a legate to represent me, the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], in a faraway land. I am mulling over some of the potential candidates, and they all have their good points and bad points and how they can further the glory of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith. Which one do I think will do a good job representing our interests and the will of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]?"
 VIETtrinity.0005.a:0 "An outspoken firebrand who will inspire locals with fervor"
 VIETtrinity.0005.b:0 "A wise scholar who can gauge how able local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] are"
 VIETtrinity.0005.c:0 "A personal acquaintance who's loyal but admittedly isn’t great"
 VIETtrinity.0005.d:0 "A dour stoic who, while dutiful, isn’t always that good at diplomacy"
 VIETtrinity.0005.e:0 "A cheerful one who knows how to negotiate but can be careless"
 VIETtrinity.0006.t:0 "Temporal Power"
 VIETtrinity.0006.desc:0 "Every now and then, I hear about how some secular rulers are resentful of the power I wield as a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip].\n\nSuch sentiments are ironic, of course. I do not think I have much temporal power; there are warlords with plenty of lands and wealth, yet they clearly envy the spiritual influence I possess over many [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdherentNamePlural]. Some of them see me as nothing more than another petty monarch or warlord with rival interests, and even then I sometimes hear others claiming that I and those who work under me have no business worrying about administrative matters.\n\nAnyways, hearing about all this troubles me."
 VIETtrinity.0006.a:0 "They misunderstand my intentions! We need to work together."
 VIETtrinity.0006.b:0 "I am the representative of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]! I am beyond temporal power."
 VIETtrinity.0006.c:0 "If they ever threaten me, they’ll find I'm no soft, delicate [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')]."
 VIETtrinity.0007.t:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] Officials"
 VIETtrinity.0007.desc:0 "A number of officials that have come to work under me in my capacity as the [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] have been praised for both their adherence to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] doctrine, and their abilities to administer well. Justified or not, many claim it is thanks to my inspiring, virtuous, pious leadership that follows and honors [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] teachings."
 VIETtrinity.0007.a:0 "They honor [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] through their good work."
 VIETtrinity.0007.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the aftermath of the Gregorian Reforms of the high medieval period, the Catholic Church transformed to become increasingly centralized. Its religious bureaucracy grew in order to better manage its assets and influence. Overall, it was not merely a secular state with superficial trappings of religiosity. Instead, much of its administrative growth was developed to help it adjust to its expanding religious responsibilities and spiritual authority - too far, Protestants and some of their predecessors argued, though there were various efforts at reform over the years."
 VIETtrinity.0008.t:0 "Calculating the Apocalypse"
 VIETtrinity.0008.desc:0 "I received a tempestuous letter from a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scholar today, and my staff urged me to read it because they thought it presented some interesting ideas.Though the tone of the letter was formal and proper, it was also fiery and passionate as well.\n\nIn the letter, this scholar spoke about the apocalypse, and how we could better predict when it could come based on various studies of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] scriptures, and mathematical calculations from astrological science.\n\n“[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName], if we are to protect the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faithful against the end of days, we must study sacred texts, prophecies, and natural philosophy,” the letter urged me. “If we have a better idea of when the apocalypse is coming, we can do a lot to fight against the evils that will be perpetuated by the agents of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.DevilName].”"
 VIETtrinity.0008.a:0 "Another lunatic raving about the apocalypse. Can I see another letter now?"
 VIETtrinity.0008.b:0 "Good points. I’ll encourage [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and scholars to look into this more."
 VIETtrinity.0008.c:0 "Sounds a bit heretical. Tell local [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] to keep an eye on this scholar."
 VIETtrinity.0008.info:0 "#emphasis Historical Context:#! In the medieval era, astrology was increasingly accepted as a tool for calculating the date of the apocalypse in Christian Europe, as new theories developed about how the celestial bodies influenced great events on earth. The famous philosopher and friar, Roger Bacon, for example, was a proponent of these. In 1266, he sent a letter to Pope Clement IV championing the ideas of the Arab astrologer and scholar Abu Ma’shar, who argued major religious changes correlated to planetary conjunctions. In particular, Bacon argued there was one final religious sect yet to appear, indicated by the conjunction of Jupiter and the moon, which he believed to be the cult of the Antichrist during the apocalypse."
 VIETtrinity.0009.t:0 "A Good Sermon"
 VIETtrinity.0009.desc:0 "Today, I gave a public sermon on various aspects of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] and about [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] theology. To my relief, it was well-received, and I even heard some in the audience say that they felt as if they could feel [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] speaking through me! Some have already written down the words I spoke to disseminate it to other [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] communities around the world."
 VIETtrinity.0009.a:0 "I am glad to hear that."
 VIETtrinity.0010.t:0 "A Bad Sermon"
 VIETtrinity.0010.desc:0 "Today, I gave a public sermon on various aspects of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.ReligiousText] and about [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] theology. Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to be very well-received by my audience. Some thought it was too boring, others full of irrelevant language. I can only hope this does not reflect badly on the state of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] affairs around the world."
 VIETtrinity.0010.a:0 "I hope it won’t be as bad next time."
 VIETtrinity.0011.t:0 "A Profound Moment"
 VIETtrinity.0011.desc:0 "Just now, I finished writing a short letter to one of my legates who represent my interests elsewhere in this world, just one of many [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] out there.\n\nSomehow, when I finished, I felt a sense of peace and joy, as if something wonderful had happened. The thing is, I had just given the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] some advice on miscellaneous theological matters and yet….\n\nSomething about it feels profound that is hard for me to describe in words."
 VIETtrinity.0011.a:0 "It must be [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName], giving me the strength I need to do my work."
 VIETtrinity.0011.b:0 "I have an urge to go outside to admire the nature which [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] created."
 VIETtrinity.0012.t:0 "A Difficult Issue"
 VIETtrinity.0012.desc:0 "Just now, I finished writing a short letter to one of my legates who represent my interests elsewhere in this world, and who are one of many [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] out there who answer to me. This [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] had asked for some advice on a local spiritual matter, and I have to admit, it was a difficult issue to contemplate. I spent longer than expected formulating my answer, and a part of me doubts whether what I told the [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] was right, but I did my best."
 VIETtrinity.0012.a:0 "I need a break. Time to take a good walk outside."
 VIETtrinity.0012.b:0 "I trust that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] guided me well."
 VIETtrinity.0012.c:0 "These letters can be frustrating, but it’s my solemn duty."
 VIETtrinity.0013.t:0 "A Decline?"
 VIETtrinity.0013.desc:0 "A prominent [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] has sent me a letter complaining about the need for stricter discipline with [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and other important members of the [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] clergy. Based on the letter’s arguments, there has been a decline in the quality of various [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] and their abilities and virtue in recent times, and this must be addressed, lest it cause doubt and heresy to spread."
 VIETtrinity.0013.a:0 "True. We should discipline bad [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitlePlural')] more if needed."
 VIETtrinity.0013.b:0 "I’m happy with how things are. I trust that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] will guide us."
 VIETtrinity.0013.c:0 "This [ROOT.Char.Custom('DefaultPriestTitle')] is obviously rambling about frivolous things."
 VIETtrinity.0014.t:0 "Opulence and Luxury"
 VIETtrinity.0014.desc:0 "I have lately heard gossip from many quarters about how I have been living a life most unfit for a [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], one full of opulence and luxury. One can only wonder how such rumors started, but some have suggested I need to cut back on various frivolous expenses and trinkets, as it were."
 VIETtrinity.0014.a:0 "I’m not that kind of [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]! How dare they question my authority!"
 VIETtrinity.0014.b:0 "Perhaps it would do to cut down on expenses, to set an example."
 VIETtrinity.0014.c:0 "Interesting rumors…. But I live virtuously enough already?"
 VIETtrinity.0015.t:0 "A Lack of Peace"
 VIETtrinity.0015.desc:0 "Sometimes, I worry about the wars that [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] nobility and patricians constantly wage against each other for greater power and profit. How is it that they constantly fight like this, when there are heretics and heathens out there who seek to undermine our [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetAdjective] faith?"
 VIETtrinity.0015.a:0 "I must redouble my efforts to encourage peace and understanding."
 VIETtrinity.0015.b:0 "If they fight, they fight. It is all the will of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName]."
 VIETtrinity.0015.c:0 "As long as they don’t question me, I suppose I can’t complain."
